To apply the approach clone the project into your IDE.

Use Python 3.10 or higher to install the requirements listed in the requirements_thesis.txt file

You need a machine with a GPU to fine-tune BERT.


Using the following command you can execute our approach
python main.py {autoencoder or iforst} {ID}
